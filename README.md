## Summary

In this repository I built and evaluated several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data typically seen from peer-to-peer lending services. I will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:

1. Resampling
2. Ensemble Learning
